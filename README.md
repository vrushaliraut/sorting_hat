# Project Description
Implement SortingHat : A school hostel assignment Program
New students join a school and need to be assigned to one of 4 boarding houses. As students come in,
they register their roll number, class & food preference. There are 2 classes - 
A and B, and two food preferences - V & NV. There are 4 boarding houses with equal but limited capacity.
The hat follows a first in first out policy with the following rules -
● Queue will be processed based on the time a student registered, first in first out
● Boarding houses for students who prefer V cannot board NV students
● Boarding houses for class A would be separate from boarding houses for class B
● Once all boarding houses are filled up to capacity, no more students can be allocated.
● Other rules
○ Roll number is a 4 digit integer unique to each student
○ Student can only be registered once, duplicate commands for same student may be
ignored
